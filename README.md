# Admin Panel for "Anny Kaktus" owner

## Developed by Andrés Rodríguez (pulgueta)

### This panel will be hosted on Firebase as well as the main Web views for the user.

The admin panel has the following features:

- Adding products to the main database (Firestore & Cloud Storage).
- Deleting products from the main database (Firestore & Cloud Storage).
- Updating products from the main database (Firestore only).

## The actions taken in this panel will be reflected in the user interface as well.

The link to this panel is not going to be available in this repository, but some screenshots will be attached once the project is finished.
